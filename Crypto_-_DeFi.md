# DeFi Total Value Locked Has Tripled This Year Despite Recent Bitcoin, Ethereum-Led Crypto Carnage



**Why It Matters:** TVL is a measure of the total value of assets that are locked into the DeFi ecosystem. The metric does not track the amount of outstanding loans but instead provides information on the total amount of underlying supply secured by either a specific application or DeFi in its entirety.

A large portion of the value locked in DeFi protocols is due to the price of native tokens along with deposits of BTC and ETH, but the recent fall in the markets has contributed to the decline in total TVL, [reported](https://cointelegraph.com/news/defi-token-prices-obliterated-as-bitcoin-sell-off-knocks-tvl-under-100b) Cointelegraph.

#### #### A beginner's guide to DeFi

"DeFi‚Äù or open finance, aims to recreate traditional financial systems (such as lending, borrowing, derivatives, and exchange) with automation in place of middlemen. 

primary venue for decentralized finance is [Ethereum](https://blog.coinbase.com/a-beginners-guide-to-ethereum-46dd486ceecf), but in principle these ideas can be implemented on any smart contract platform

***Stablecoins***

*Decentralized lending.* - Programmatically take out a loan on the blockchain. No bank account required.

*Decentralized exchanges* - Buy and sell cryptocurrencies through a blockchain, rather than a centralized exchange like Coinbase. In principle, a machine can trade on these!

*Collateralization* - Provide digital assets to collateralize your decentralized loans, providing the lender some recourse in the event of default.

*Decentralized Identity*

***Composability*** - Snapping together DeFi functions that do different things, much like software libraries. For example, if one contract takes in crypto and generates interest, the second contract could automatically reinvest that interest.

*Risk management* - High returns in DeFi are often accompanied by even higher risks. Fortunately, new tools are arising to help hedge these risks.
